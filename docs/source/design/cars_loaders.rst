CARS loaders
=================


CARS modularities aims at :
- Be able to load different geometry libraries
- Be able to load different matching libraries
- Be able to use different opening image tools
- Be able to use different cluster scheduling strategy/tools

The goals are:
- answer different project and user goals.
- ease 3D studies and definition/test of new algorithms
- simplify evolution when a library is becoming obsolete

In CARS, we call "loader" the generic way to include 

The loaders implementations can be internal or external.
