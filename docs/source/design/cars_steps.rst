CARS steps
==========

A step is a set of functional algorithms considered as a 3D block in CARS 3D pipelines.
They operate only on one tile (no cluster scheduling approach considered).

The current steps are

- Rectification:
    - generate_grid()
    -

- Matching:

- Triangulation:
    - triangulate()
    - ...

- Filter cloud:
    -

- Rasterize:
    - rasterization()


Questions:

- prepare steps functions?
